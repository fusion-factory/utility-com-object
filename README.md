Flow Utility COM Object
Purpose of this project is to provide a Flow-usable COM wrapper for selected .Net classes
This branch includes a wrapper for an AS400 object (not standard .Net)
Future plans are to create a stand-alone AS400 wrapper.
The solution utilises WiX extensions to create an MSI installer
To build the solution you will need to install WiX Tool and the Visual Studio extension
